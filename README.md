This code extracts MFCC features from a given dataset
I divided the dataset based on two categories Male/Female 
then i combined the features in a csv file and compared them with eachother


you can download the dataset from here : https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets (I selected the common voice delta 19.0) 

the dataset contains Metadata about the collected clips (clip_durations,invalidated,reported,unvalidated_sentences,validated_sentences and Validated clips)
